# Todo.sh
**Todo.sh** is a lightweight bash script that allows you to use general purpose *to do list* for your programs, shopping lists, notes or everything you need to keep in your mind. Your lists are stored in local *'/.todo'* text files so they are human-readable and editable with your favourite text-editor.

## Script configuration
Give it execution permissions:
```bash
chmod +x Todo.sh
```
Add in your *~/.bashrc* file:
```bash
alias todo='/path/to/Todo.sh'
```
## Use
* *todo init:*
* *todo add:*
* *todo rm:*
* *todo ls:*
* *todo check:*
* *todo destroy:*
